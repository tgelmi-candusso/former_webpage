I am a researcher hosted by the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Toronto, my main interest are ecological interactions in relationship to their environment. As a student and as a researcher I have always been driven by the scientific questions and the experimental design rather than the specific study subjects, so far I have done research in the marine environment, in the tropical and in the temperate environment. I have explore questions ranging from cliamte change and its effect in the physiology and survival of organisms, into animal behaviour and how their behaviour affects the molecular and macro world surrounding them, through species interactions.
    
During the PhD degree I started studying how animal behaviour can change plants at the population genetics level, by carrying with them their offspring, which made me increasingly curious on how animal movement influences the landscape through seed dispersal and how the landscape influences animal movement. I currently work on understanding how landscape influences animal movement in the most fragmented and inhospitable landscape there is, cities.
